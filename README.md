# GitHub Pages Simple Dark Theme

*A simple dark theme for GitHub pages with no frills*

## Usage
To use this theme, add the following line to your sites `_config.yml` file
```
remote_theme: ThomasBoxall/ghp-simple-dark
```

Then when you deploy the page to GitHub pages, you will get a simple dark (and vaguely responsive) dark theme. 

## References/ Aknowledgements
To make something like this has really poor documentation. All the documentation sources send you off down a rabbit hole of installing Jekyll & Ruby and messing around with Gem Files and Bundlers. Surprisingly, you don't actually need to do that.

The sources listed below were the most useful in getting this to work.
* [sindresorhus/github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) - CSS
* [benc-uk/theme-msdark](https://github.com/benc-uk/theme-msdark) - An almost barebones Jekyll theme which proved the concept was possible. 

## Demo
A demonstration of the theme can be found [here](demo.md)
